   ```properties
   settings.use-reactive-raknet=true
   ```

2. Start your Nukkit server:
   ```bash
   java -jar nukkit.jar
   ```

3. Look for confirmation in logs:
   ```
   [INFO] Using Reactive RakNet implementation for enhanced performance
   ```

### **Production Configuration**
```properties
# Enable reactive RakNet
settings.use-reactive-raknet=true

# Optional: Advanced settings
settings.reactive-raknet.session-timeout=300
settings.reactive-raknet.max-sessions=1000
settings.reactive-raknet.enable-statistics=true
```
